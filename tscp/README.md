# $TS-CP^2$ replication

## Quickstart to reproduce results from table 2 of the article (Deldari, Shohreh, et al., (2021)) for $TS-CP^2$ model
Open and run all in Google Colab notebooks:

- TSCP2_dataset_name_HASC_win_60_code_size_10_epochs_100.ipynb



Replicated results:

| Dataset     | F1 with margin        |     F1 with margin   |
| ----------- | ----------------------|----------------------|
| HASC        | win:60,bs:64    0.4138|win:60,bs:64          |
| USC         | win:60,bs:64          |win:60,bs:64          |



notes:
- It is recommended to use GPU to obtain results faster
